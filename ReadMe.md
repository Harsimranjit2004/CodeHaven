# **CodeHaven**

**CodeHaven** is a custom-built deployment platform inspired by Vercel, engineered to streamline web app hosting. It automates the process from cloning and building a Git repository to serving the live applicationâ€”all within a robust, scalable architecture. Initially designed for static frameworks like React and Vite, CodeHaven is extensible to dynamic setups (e.g., Express, Next.js), showcasing expertise in distributed systems, containerization, and real-time communication.
